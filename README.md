# Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment for running JavaScript locally. However, Node.js does not support any functions related to the `window` object.

# package.json

The `package.json` file in Node.js is a metadata file that contains important information about your project, including:

- Project name
- Version
- Description
- Main entry point
- Scripts
- Dependencies
- And more

It helps manage dependencies, run scripts, and provides key details about the project, making it easier to maintain and share.

# Modules

A module is a reusable piece of code that can be easily imported and used in other parts of your application. Modules in Node.js help you to organize your code into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier to maintain and understand.
